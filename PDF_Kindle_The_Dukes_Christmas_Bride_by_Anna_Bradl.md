Against the Bridgerton-era backdrop of Regency London, Anna Bradleyâ€™s witty and sexy trilogy sets fiercely alpha dukes against the duchesses who are determined to transform their delinquent husbands by any means necessary. A delight for fans of Mary Jo Putney, Sabrina Jeffries, Ella Quinn, Diana Quincy and Julia Quinn.
 
 For one determined duke, thereâ€™s nothing like coming home for Christmasâ€”even if it means kicking open the doorâ€”and finding the key to his own long closed heart on the other side . . .
 
 Alarmed by the sound of an intruder, Rose St. Claire fetches her pistol. Sheâ€™s shocked to discover that the trespasser is a handsome gentlemanâ€”one who states that the house, which Rose recently inherited from her late benefactor, was stolen from his father decades ago. He claims it is now his. And it isâ€”but not entirely. As it turns out, Hammond Court has been left to them bothâ€”and neither can evict the other without forfeiting their right to the property . . .
 
 Wealthy and ruthless, Maxwell Burke, Duke of Grantham, has spent years regaining the many properties his father lost to bad wagers. Only Hammond Court remains. But Rose has no intention of leaving. In fact, as Christmas draws near, circumstances force Max to plan a holiday party, and Rose is all too happy to help. Max despises such merrimentâ€”until he sees it as an opportunity . . .
 
 Max will forgive the debt of another young dukeâ€™s family if the attractive gentleman woos Rose at the party, ultimately marries herâ€”and returns her share of the estate to Max. Itâ€™s foolproof. Except that Roseâ€™s spirited joy is seductive, recalling within Max long ago feelings of happinessâ€”and awakening a deep attraction. Has Max cooked his own Christmas gooseâ€”or is there a chance love will prevail? . . .
