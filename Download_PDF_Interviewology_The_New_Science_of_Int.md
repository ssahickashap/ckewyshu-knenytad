“A must-read for seasoned and new managers alike.” —Johnny C. Taylor Jr., SHRM-SCP, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) A groundbreaking guide to mastering the job interview, offering proven advice and techniques to discover your unique interview style that is key to interviewing better—for those on either side of the table. Conventional interviewing advice doesn’t work. That’s what Anna Papalia learned through years of experience as an HR professional, consultant for Fortune 500 companies, and teacher at the Fox School of Business. None of the existing tools work for one simple reason: they don’t get to the heart of what actually makes a great interview—self-awareness. At its core, an interview is a set of questions about you. If you don’t know yourself, you won’t do well. Determined to make the process better, more inclusive, and less obscure, Anna spent years researching how people interview and uncovered a new science to interviewing, rooted in the finding that there are four main styles people exhibit in an interview: you can be a Charmer, a Challenger, an Examiner, or a Harmonizer. Your style influences how you view and approach interviews, and ultimately how you perform in them. In Interviewology, Anna teaches you how to identify your individual style (and that of who you are interviewing with) and offers pragmatic tips for using this knowledge to nail your next interview. Packed with wisdom, Interviewology offers clarity and a dynamic, scientifically validated approach that challenges everything you thought you knew about interviewing, providing unique insight into the process, debunking some of the most common myths, and explaining how you can perform better, whether you’re applying for the job or looking for the right candidate. Going beyond generic advice that isn’t useful in the real world—such as memorizing rote answers or strict guidelines—Interviewology is a revolutionary approach that focuses on self-awareness—and how to develop it—to help everyone master their own unique interview style. It’s about the power of knowing yourself and how that insight can lead to a more successful career and life.
