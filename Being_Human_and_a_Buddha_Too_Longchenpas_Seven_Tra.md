Overview
In writing that sparkles and inspires, Anne Klein (Lama Rigzin Drolma) shows us how to liberate our buddha nature to be both human and a buddha too.

 This first volume in the House of Adzom series centers on Longchenpaâ€™s seven trainings in bodhicitta, our awakened mind, the ultimate purpose of our practice and training. Anne Kleinâ€™s original composition masterfully weaves in Adzom Paylo Rinpocheâ€™s commentary and Jigme Lingpaâ€™s five pith practices and commentary on the trainings, in keeping with Longchenpaâ€™s skillful integration of sutra, tantra, and Dzogchen, to resolve our most challenging questions about what awakening involves and how it relates to the truth of our human situation right now. As foundational teachings for Dzogchen practitioners, the seven trainings are framed as contemplations on impermanence, the adventitiousness of happiness and its short duration, the multiple causes of death, the meaninglessness of our worldly activities, reliance on the Buddhaâ€™s good qualities, the teacherâ€™s pith instructions, and, ultimately, nonconceptual meditation on bliss and emptiness, clarity and emptiness, and reality itself.
