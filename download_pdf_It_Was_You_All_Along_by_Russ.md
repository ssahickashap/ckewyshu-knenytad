Overview
Notes From Your Bookseller If you&#039;re looking for a companion in your journey to personal growth, Russ delivers. Paralleling his own journey, each chapter provides fresh inspiration to help keep you going. The self-made musical artist follows his bestseller ITâ€™S ALL IN YOUR HEAD with this second inspirational book for everyone whoâ€™s looking for answers in all the wrong places. Itâ€™s a book about self-empowerment, self-awareness, and ultimately self-love. Independent rapper, songwriter, singer, and producer Russ sells out concerts across America and around the globe, collaborating with top artists, such as Snoop Dogg, Joey Bada$$, Ed Sheeran, Rick Ross, Lil Baby, Jadakiss, Bia, and Mozzy to name a few. At twenty-seven, he became a bestselling author with the publication of his debut book, ITâ€™S ALL IN YOUR HEAD. Now, at thirty-one, Russ returns with a second book even more profound and intimate than his first. Building on his message of self-acceptance, It Was You All Along goes deeper into Russâ€™s heart and soul as it tracks the keys to knowing and loving yourself. The book addresses the question posed by the subtitleâ€”what if youâ€™re the one youâ€™ve been waiting for?â€”a line from Russâ€™s first album inspired by his motherâ€™s advice. Success comes from loving and believing in yourself and working hard regardless of obstacles and naysayers. Published in conjunction with his tour of the same name, It Was You All Along expands on themes found in Russâ€™s music and across his albums, and each chapter title takes the name of a track. Russ has always followed his own beatâ€”and shows you how to find your own unique rhythm, offering motivational wisdom on everything from trust, discipline, and letting go to authenticity, joy, and faith. Packed with moving observances, It Was You All Along gives fans a rare look into the man behind the music and the challenges he continues to face both personally and as an independent artist. Russ gets deeply personal in these pages, revealing how seeing a therapist helped him understand his relationship with his family and realize that he was so overly focused on helping everyone in his orbit when the person who needed his attention most was himself. Russ uses his immense passion, his experiences, and his love for people to inspire us all. His honesty and straightforwardness will convince even the most reluctant reader that the answer can always be found within. An artist known for his powerful lyrics, Russ uses his songwriting gifts to craft prose that is moving, memorable, and motivational.
