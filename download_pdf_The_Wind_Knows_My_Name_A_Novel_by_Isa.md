This powerful and moving novel from the New York Times bestselling author of A Long Petal of the Sea and Violeta weaves together past and present, tracing the ripple effects of war and immigration on one child in Europe in 1938 and another in the United States in 2019.

 Vienna, 1938. Samuel Adler is five years old when his father disappears during Kristallnachtâ€”the night his family loses everything. As her childâ€™s safety becomes ever harder to guarantee, Samuelâ€™s mother secures a spot for him on a Kindertransport train out of Nazi-occupied Austria to England. He boards alone, carrying nothing but a change of clothes and his violin.

 Arizona, 2019. Eight decades later, Anita DÃ­az and her mother board another train, fleeing looming danger in El Salvador and seeking refuge in the United States. But their arrival coincides with the new family separation policy, and seven-year-old Anita finds herself alone at a camp in Nogales. She escapes her tenuous reality through her trips to Azabahar, a magical world of the imagination. Meanwhile, Selena DurÃ¡n, a young social worker, enlists the help of a successful lawyer in hopes of tracking down Anitaâ€™s mother.

 Intertwining past and present, The Wind Knows My Name tells the tale of these two unforgettable characters, both in search of family and home. It is both a testament to the sacrifices that parents make and a love letter to the children who survive the most unfathomable dangersâ€”and never stop dreaming.
