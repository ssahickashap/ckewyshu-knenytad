Five Nights at Freddy&amp;#039;s fans won&amp;#039;t want to miss this collection of three chilling stories that will haunt even the bravest player... Would you ever cut corners to get what you want? . . . Outsourcing their storytelling to artificial intelligence comes with unintended results for the executives of the Fazbear Entertainment board of directors. . . Tony’s search for the player behind the impossibly high scores at the Pizzaplex Fazcade leads him down a rabbit hole with no way out . . . And Abe’s journey to find the first generation animatronics causing problem for his Bobbiedot home assistants lead him to believe he should have never moved into his new apartment . . . In the world of Five Nights at Freddy&amp;#039;s sometimes a shortcut can lead to a dead end. . . In this fifth volume, Five Nights at Freddy&amp;#039;s creator Scott Cawthon spins three sinister novella-length tales from uncharted corners of his series&amp;#039; canon. Readers beware: This collection of terrifying tales is enough to rattle even the most hardened Five Nights at Freddy&amp;#039;s fans.
